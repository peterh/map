Map Generator
=============

Fed up with assembling maps by hand (large tiles never have the shape you need, and
small tiles take forever to assemble), this application was written to generate maps
from an ascii sketch of the map.

The style was inspired by Wyrframe's Shady Halls.

Simple example:
```
Output: example.png

/##\
####   /##\
###########
\##/   ####
       \##/
```

Two octagonal rooms connected by a corridor, with the transparent map outline written
to `example.png`.
